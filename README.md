### ðŸ“Œ **1. DPI (Dots Per Inch)**

**What it means:**
How many dots (or pixels) are printed in one inch of paper.

**Example:**

* 300 DPI = 300 dots (pixels) in every inch.
* Higher DPI = better print quality.

**Real-life use:**

* A passport photo might need 300 DPI to look sharp on paper.
* Web images donâ€™t care much about DPI, only pixel size.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Pixel**

**What it means:**
The smallest unit of a digital image. Like one tiny dot of color.

**Example:**
An image that's **1920 Ã— 1080 pixels** means:

* 1920 tiny dots left to right (width)
* 1080 tiny dots top to bottom (height)

**Real-life use:**

* A Full HD TV is 1920Ã—1080 pixels.
* More pixels = more detail.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **3. Resolution**

**What it means:**
The **total number of pixels** in an image (width Ã— height).

**Example:**

* 3000Ã—2000 pixels = high resolution
* 100Ã—100 pixels = low resolution (blurry if stretched)

**Real-life use:**

* Photos from a DSLR camera have high resolution.
* A WhatsApp profile pic may have low resolution.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **4. File Size (KB, MB)**

**What it means:**
The size of the image file on disk, measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).

**Example:**

* 100 KB = small image
* 2 MB = large, high-quality image

**Real-life use:**

* Government portals may ask for "15 KB photo max"
* Social media compresses images to smaller size

---

### ðŸ“Œ **5. Aspect Ratio**

**What it means:**
The **ratio of width to height**.

**Example:**

* 4:3 â†’ like old TVs
* 16:9 â†’ widescreen
* 1:1 â†’ square image

**Real-life use:**

* Instagram profile photos are square (1:1)
* YouTube videos are 16:9

---

### ðŸ“Œ **6. Compression (Lossy vs Lossless)**

**What it means:**
Reducing file size, sometimes by removing detail.

**Types:**

* **Lossy**: Smaller file, lower quality (e.g., JPEG)
* **Lossless**: Keeps all data, bigger file (e.g., PNG)

**Real-life use:**

* JPEG is great for photos (lossy)
* PNG is best for logos (no blur, transparent background)

---

### ðŸ“Œ **7. CMYK vs RGB**

**What it means:**
Color modes:

* **RGB (Red Green Blue)**: For screens
* **CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black)**: For printing

**Real-life use:**

* If you're printing a brochure, convert to CMYK.
* If it's just for viewing online, RGB is perfect.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **8. Transparency / Alpha Channel**

**What it means:**
Ability of an image to have a **see-through background**.

**Real-life use:**

* Logos with no white box around them use transparency.
* Only PNG, WebP support it (not JPEG).

### ðŸ“Œ **9. Image Format**

**What it means:**
The type of file your image is saved as.

| Format   | Used for                 | Notes                       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| JPG/JPEG | Photos                   | Small size, no transparency |
| PNG      | Logos, graphics          | Transparency, sharper edges |
| GIF      | Short animations         | Limited colors              |
| BMP      | Old format, uncompressed | Very large size             |
| WEBP     | Modern web images        | Small size + transparency   |
